## Killswitch

This provides code and scripts for the killswitch functionality of the Cyclone Robosub AUV.
**Please leave kill.sh, start.sh, and status.sh in the top level directory!** These are used by the operator, and must be in the top level directory.

This repo should be cloned into the home directory of the pi (/home/propulsion) in order for the PATH environment variable to match reality.
