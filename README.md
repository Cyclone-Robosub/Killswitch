## Killswitch

This provides code and scripts for the killswitch functionality of the Cyclone Robosub AUV.
**Please leave kill.sh, start.sh, and status.sh in the top level directory!** These are used by the robot operator from the command line, and must be in the top level directory.

This repo should be cloned into the home directory of the pi (/home/propulsion) in order for the PATH environment variable to match reality.

The Dashboard/ directory contains files used for the Cyclone Dashboard. They shouldn't be used directly by the robot operator.
